## Get started in three steps

Connect to our secure WebSocket API and start receiving real-time orderbook data from 52+ active exchanges across 70+ supported platforms with SSL/TLS encryption. Plus access our Unified Transaction APIs for multi-exchange transaction processing.

### Step 1: Get your API key

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Obtain API credentials">
    Contact our support team to get your API key with access to:
    - **50GB monthly data limit**
    - **WebSocket-only connections** 
    - **Real-time orderbook updates**
    - **52+ active exchanges across 70+ supported platforms**
    
    Your API key will be in the format: `demo_key_123`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Monitor your usage">
    Track your data consumption in real-time:
    ```bash
    curl "https://data.quantcite.com/api/v1/data-usage/YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    
    <Tip>Monitor usage regularly to avoid hitting the 50GB monthly limit.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Connect to WebSocket

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wifi" title="Establish secure WebSocket connection">
    Connect to our secure WebSocket endpoint:
    ```
    wss://data.quantcite.com/api/v1/ws
    ```
    
    **Note:** Authentication is now done via WebSocket message, not URL parameter for enhanced security.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="handshake" title="Authenticate your session">
    After connecting, send an authentication message:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "authenticate",
      "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
    }
    ```
    
    You'll receive a welcome message with session ID and tier information.
