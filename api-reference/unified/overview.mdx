## Overview

The Unified Transaction APIs provide a standardized interface for fetching and processing cryptocurrency transactions across multiple exchanges. These APIs use **session-based authentication** similar to the WebSocket API for enhanced security.

### Supported Transaction Types

The unified API supports various transaction types across exchanges:

- **Deposits** - Incoming funds to your account
- **Withdrawals** - Outgoing funds from your account  
- **Trades** - Spot and derivatives trading transactions
- **Transfers** - Internal transfers between accounts
- **Holdings** - Current account balances
- **Futures** - Linear and inverse futures trading
- **Leverage Tokens** - Leveraged token transactions

### Data Format

All transactions follow a standardized format for consistency across exchanges:

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  transactionId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  label: string;
  sentCurrency?: {
    currency: string;
    amount: number;
  };
  receivedCurrency?: {
    currency: string;
    amount: number;
  };
  fee?: {
    currency: string;
    amount: number;
  };
  sender?: {
    name?: string;
    public_name?: string;
    walletId?: string;
  };
